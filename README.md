# Teddy
A simple tile grid editor

Teddy is programmed using the Python language and the Tkinter library. Many thanks to all the people behind these marvelous tools!

Teddy is a hommage to two great tools of the past like **TEd** (also known as TED5), made by John Romero and [used for more than 30 games](https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/DavidLightbown/20170223/289955/Classic_Tools_Retrospective_John_Romero_talks_about_creating_TEd_the_tile_editor_that_shipped_over_30_games.php), or the map editor of **Warcraft II**.

Teddy is a program to edit tile grids, in order to make levels or maps for video games. A map consists of one or more **layers** which are a matrix of integer.

Teddy uses the concept of **mod**. A mod is set of **tiles** and **layers** which will be available to create the map.

For a real-time strategy game for example, you can have a layer *ground* for the ground tiles and a layer *unit* where you will store the units.

You can create your own mod, it is only a set of pictures for the tiles and a [JSON file](https://www.json.org/json-en.html "a lightweight data-interchange format") for configuring the mod.

Teddy is free and open source.
